## **üîç STRATEGY DETAILS**

### **Original Naked Puts Strategy Logic:**
```python
# Classic naked put selling execution
if spy_close > trade['strike']:
    # Put expires worthless - we keep full premium
    profit = trade['premium'] * trade['contracts'] * 100
    outcome = 'EXPIRED_WORTHLESS'
else:
    # Put assigned - calculate loss
    intrinsic_value = trade['strike'] - spy_close
    net_loss = intrinsic_value - trade['premium']
    profit = -net_loss * trade['contracts'] * 100
    outcome = 'ASSIGNED'
```

### **Key Parameters:**
- **Strategy Type**: `'balanced_put_sales'`
- **Strike Selection**: 0.5-3.0 below SPY (closer to ATM)
- **Premium Range**: $0.05 - $2.00
- **Risk Management**: Max $200 loss per trade
- **Position Size**: 1-2 contracts base

### **Unified System Components:**
1. **Primary Strategy**: Balanced naked puts (46% execution rate)
2. **Counter Strategy**: Focused approach for filtered days
3. **Intelligent Switching**: Primary first, counter when needed
4. **Risk Management**: Conservative position sizing and loss limits

---

## **‚ö†Ô∏è WHY IT WAS CHANGED**

### **Capital Requirements Issue:**
- **Naked Puts**: Required $50,000+ buying power per contract
- **Capital Intensive**: Made strategy inaccessible for smaller accounts
- **Broker Restrictions**: Many brokers limit/prohibit naked options

### **Conversion to Spreads:**
- **Bull Put Spreads**: Limited risk, lower capital requirements
- **Same Logic**: Identical filtering and strike selection
- **Capital Efficiency**: Accessible for $25K accounts
- **Risk Management**: Capped max loss vs unlimited naked put risk
