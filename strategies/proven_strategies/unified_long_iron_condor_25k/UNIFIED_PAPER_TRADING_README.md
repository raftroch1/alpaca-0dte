- **Strategy:** Primary balanced bull put spreads only
- **Performance:** ~46% execution rate, $21.11/day average (2K account)
- **Trades:** Only when primary strategy conditions are met

### 🔹 Unified System Version (NEW) ⭐

- **Trades:** Primary strategy + counter strategy for filtered days

## 🎯 Unified System Features

## 🔍 Key Differences in Live Trading

**Unified System Logic:**
1. **Step 1:** Try primary strategy (balanced bull put spreads)
2. **Step 2:** If primary filtered → Try counter strategy
3. **Result:** Higher execution rate, more opportunities

**You'll see logs like:**
```
🎯 UNIFIED SYSTEM EXECUTION - SPY: $525.50
📈 STEP 1: Trying PRIMARY Strategy (Balanced Bull Put Spreads)
❌ PRIMARY FILTERED: Premium $0.030 below minimum $0.050
🛡️ STEP 2: Trying COUNTER Strategy (Focused Counter Spreads)
🎯 Selected counter scenario: low_premium
✅ COUNTER: Executing closer ATM spread at $525
```

## 🎯 Recommendation

**Start with Primary-Only** to get familiar, then **upgrade to Unified** for higher execution rate and profits!

Both systems use the **exact same bull put spreads** - the unified system just captures more opportunities on filtered days.
